# Support-Vector-Machine
## Introduction
Support vector machine is another simple algorithm that every machine learning expert
should have in the arsenal. Support vector machine is highly preferred by many as it
produces significant accuracy with less computation power. Support Vector Machine
abbreviated as SVM can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But it is widely
used in classification objectives. The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to
find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (N — the number of features) that distinctly
classifies the data points. To separate the two classes of data points, there are many
possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane that has the
maximum margin.
## Dataset
In this project, we are going to use synthetic data. We provided two files “X.csv” and “y.csv”
where the “X.csv” contains the information for all the instances and “y.csv” has labels
corresponding to each instance in “X.csv”. For each instance, there are two attributes and
there are total 100 instances.
